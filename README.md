## Molecular-Dynamics-Simulation-of-Lennard-Jones-Particles
Molecular Dynamics code in C++ to simulate a cubic system containing two types of Lennard-Jones particles. Implemented both the Standard Velocity-Verlet and the Multiple Time Step integration methods, optimizing the simulation by using a differentiated time step for heavier particles. The project aimed to compare the performance and accuracy of energy calculations for different particle ratios.
The file "Relatione.pdf" is the report of the simulation.
